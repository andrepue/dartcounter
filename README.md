# dartcounter Project by andrepue #
###################################

Target of the Project is to get again started to coding. I want to use Python as the programming language.
Why A Darts Counter? Well, there are several Darts counters out there already. I set up a party room with 
a dart board and have a Raspberry Pi running for music. I jsut wanted to use the Raspberry pi as a Darts 
counter at the same time. I want to create a Tool where you have just to click on a virtual dartboards fields
to count the points. I hope I get this set up using Python.
